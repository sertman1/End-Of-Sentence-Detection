When determing features, I first relied heavily on the example provided
in the homework document. I identified the different type of segment
labels, such as PTEXT and QUOTED, and found patterns (and thus features)
that distinguished one from the other.

For example, with development data, when classifying by line, the start
code yielded a result of 555 / 722  0.7686980609418282 and classifying by
segment, 53 / 78  0.6794871794871795.
